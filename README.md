# Shortest Path Using Graph

This project uses a dictionary to find the shortest path from 
a source word to a destination word by changing only one letter 
at a time.

It also ensures that each intermediate word also belongs to the
dictionary.

## Running the tests (from the project directory):

Using the command line:

    $ make clean
    $ make
    $ java -jar graph.jar

The project can also be imported into Eclipse as a standard java 
project.
